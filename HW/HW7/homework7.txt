1. A class is a template or blueprint that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from it will have. An object is an instance of a class, meaning it is a specific realization of the template with actual data. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a coding approach that uses objects to bundle data and functionality. It promotes reusability and organization through key principles such as encapsulation (hiding internal data), inheritance (sharing properties and methods between classes), polymorphism (methods behaving differently depending on the context), and abstraction (hiding complex details from the user).
2. An abstract class is used when you want to define a common structure for several related classes but don't want the abstract class itself to be instantiated. It allows you to declare methods that all child classes must implement, ensuring consistency. Additionally, it can provide shared functionality that subclasses inherit, reducing code duplication. Abstract classes are helpful when you want to enforce a certain design across a group of related classes, while still allowing for specialized behavior in each subclass.
3. Superglobals are predefined variables in PHP that are available in all scopes throughout a script, without needing to be passed explicitly. They provide access to data related to requests, sessions, and user input. For example, $_GET contains query parameters sent through a URL, and $_POST stores form data submitted via HTTP POST requests. $_SESSION manages session data that persists across different pages, while $_COOKIE stores small pieces of data on the user's browser. Other superglobals include $_FILES, which deals with uploaded files, and $_SERVER, which holds server and execution environment information.
4. The first step is to declare the namespace at the top of the class file using the namespace keyword. This helps organize the code into logical groups and avoids name conflicts between classes. The second step is to import the class where it is needed using the use keyword. This allows the code to reference the class within the correct namespace. 
5. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a design pattern used in software development to separate concerns and make the code easier to maintain. The Model handles the data and business logic of the application, interacting with the database to manage information. The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user, typically through HTML or other user interfaces. The Controller acts as the middleman between the Model and the View, receiving user input, updating the Model, and determining which View to display. This separation helps developers manage complex applications by organizing the code into distinct sections, improving both maintainability and scalability.
