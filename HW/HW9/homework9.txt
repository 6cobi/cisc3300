1. SQL is a language for managing and manipulating databases, while MySQL is an open-source system that uses SQL for database management. Relational databases store data in structured tables linked by relationships.

2. Normalization in SQL is organizing data to reduce redundancy and maintain consistency by dividing large tables into smaller, related ones.

3. Primary keys uniquely identify records in a table, while foreign keys create links between tables by referencing primary keys in another table.

4. The three main relationship types are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

5. A left join returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right, while an inner join only returns records where there is a match in both tables.
